/*Exercises
1. Using reduce , write a function that returns the product of all the ele-
ments in an array. Hint: Where += adds, *= multiplies.
2. Remove the newlines in the reduce solution from Listing 6.9 to turn it
into a single long line. Does it still give the right answer? How long is
the resulting line of code?*/

let multiplyNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

function multiplyThem(elements) {
    let answer = {};
    elements.forEach(function(n) {
answer(n) = n *= n

    }
